# vote_for_quote
A simple web app so I could learn Firebase and EJS templating.
The point is for users to upload original quotes and other users can upvote/downvote quotes

### Setup
```
npm install
```

### Development
```
npm run dev
```
#### Note
The .scss in client/scss must be compiled. Use whatever method you desire, but I have provided an npm script to accomplish this in a compressed style: `npm run client-sass`

### Build
```
npm run build
```
